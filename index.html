                    Hello! I am John Raves C. Ranara, a 20 year old,  5'7, 65 kg, second year college Computer Science student. I was born in October 16 of 2001. I have two older siblings. I have 6 pet cats and was a cat person since birth. I also have 12 tarantulas. Yes, those big creepy spiders. Anyway, I am an average person whom anyone can vibe with. Before, I consider myself as an introvert but right now I'm not really sure what kind of "vert" I am since because of the pandemic I actually found out that socializing is fun. So for now I will just label myself as an ambivert since I also run out of my social battery rather quickly. What do I do in my spare time? Well, most of the time I play games, mostly Dota 2, watch movies or series, or eat some food. I consider playing Dota 2 as a form of relaxation (though not if my teammates are toxic huhu) and past time. I also sleep a lot in my spare time because I believe that sleeping is the most essential thing for the human body. I think that is basically it. Thank you for reading and have a great day.
